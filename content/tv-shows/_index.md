I enjoy looking at what people are reading so this page is supposed to be a virtual emulation of browsing the bookshelf of a friend.
Since I read a lot of PDFs or listen to audio books this virtual bookshelf can display these as well.
At one glance I can see and remember some of the stuff I read about.
